CHANGELOG for NWH Vehicle Physics


v1.6
------------------------------
Fixed vehicles jumping / flying into the air under some specific circumstances.
Add option to freeze the vehicle when inactive.
Improved tracked vehicles.
Added Damage.Repair() function.
Fixed bug where Mobile Input Manager would throw error if Vehicle Controller was not assigned, and Vehicle Changer was.
Vehicles with larger wheels sometimes hesitate when changing from reverse to first gear.
Error when detaching the trailer in some cases.
Solved emissive meshes not emitting in demo scene build (thank you SilverSho0t).
Fixed RPM being off on the RPM gauge inside the demo scene.
Remove leftover tutorial scene.
Removed delay when shifting from reverse to forward.


v1.5
------------------------------
Changed the look of demo scene and added new auto-generated telemetry and settings menus.
Added unit converter with common conversions.
Fixed fuel consumption calculation which would result in too high fuel consumption.
Added per-vehicle option for skidmark textures.
Metrics system that provides values such as drift time, top speed, average speed, …
Removed “skidSmoothing” field for skid sound component and changed the way skid sound is calculated.
Added vehicle braking when still and not throttle applied.
Fixed trailer not being attachable in demo scene due to the wrong trailer tag.
Option for reverse lights.
Changed code for stability assist to allow for drifting at lower settings
Added drift assist.
Changed the name of Driving Aid to Driving Assist
Updated manual.


v1.4
------------------------------
Tracked vehicle support along with a new demo vehicle - Type 10 MBT.
Fixed a bug where axle RPM would be reported incorrectly resulting in vehicles having less power and requiring lower final gear ratio.
Improved lateral friction calculation - eliminated high speed instability.
Fixed Automatic transmission staying  in 2nd gear instead of changing to 1st in some cases.
Changed the way low beam / high beam light switching works.
Added ‘Ignore Tags’ field to the damage handler. Collisions with the objects that have a tag that is on this list will be ignored.
Added performance degradation option under damage. Engine, steering and sound will only be affected by damage if this option is enabled.
Removed steer smoothing and replaced it with Degrees Per Second Limit which limits the amount of degrees wheels can turn per second. 
Fixed clutch being applied while braking in 1st gear and going forward.
Improved gear skipping in auto gearbox.
Skidmarks sometimes not drawn.
Skidmarks sometimes drawn in air / over other objects.
Improved response to drivetrain RPM changes.
Sand and grass in the demo scene now have their own friction presets. Previously they incorrectly used gravel friction curve.
Improved skidmark alpha calculation.
[WC3D] Changed the way forward friction coefficient affects the forces. Increasing the coefficient will no longer increase the torque but rather the torque limit before slipping which is correct.
[WC3D] Big improvements to the general feel of Wheel Controller.
[WC3D] Fixed spring length difference between single and multiple ray modes.
[WC3D] Fixed wheel stops spinning if not powered as soon as it loses contact with surface.
[WC3D] Fixed bottoming out calculation.
[WC3D] Gizmos are only drawn when object selected to reduce clutter.
[WC3D] Fixed problem with ground detection not happening at the lateral center of the wheel when side resolution was 1, but rather to the side.
[WC3D] Scan ignore layer is now assigned through a multiple choice dropdown.


v1.3
------------------------------
- [WC3D]  Support for calipers and other non-rotating objects that move with the wheel but do not rotate.
- Added example script for setting up a vehicle at runtime.
- Fixed errors when initializing the script at runtime from another script.
- Fixed ‘Trailer tag not found’ error when Trailer tag does not exist.
- Fixed possible errors with standard assets because Unity importer fails to import standard asset  dependencies when importing required standard assets.
- Visual improvements to the demo scene.
- Other minor fixes and changes.


v1.2
------------------------------
- Horn sound.
- Replaced semi truck with GR3D’s model.
- Added power reduction option for trucks with no trailer.
- Manual clutch not working properly with manual transmission.
- [WC3D]  Wheels locked up when in neutral on a decline / incline with no user input.
- Handbrake coefficient set to 0 on all axles on some of the vehicles.
- Revlimiter not causing fuel to cut off / no speed limit per gear.
- All cameras on playground (mobile) scene are set to disabled.
- Manual transmission sometimes ignores the input.
- Trailer attach detach sometimes ignores user input.
- When using multiple trailers some of the trailers might not show attach prompt.
- Brakes toggling between on and off state when standing still under braking.
- Incorrect default clutch engagement curve.
- Fixed reverse gear ordering when gears list is constructed.
- Added missing tooltip explanations for trailer custom inspector.
- Added shift safeguards for manual transmission when going from forward to reverse gears and other way around.


v1.1
------------------------------
- 0 garbage creation.
- Added flip over feature.
- Damped interior sound when camera is inside the vehicle.
- Separate forward and reverse gear lists.
- Unlimited number of reverse gears.
- Improvements to the automatic gearbox.
- Random shift duration and shift point (works along with the dynamic shift point).
- Manual clutch with input binding.
- Handbrake is now a float instead of bool.


v1.0
------------------------------
- Initial.
